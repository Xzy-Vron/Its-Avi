//       "In my second year, I got introduced to Data Structures using C++. Initially, it was difficult to understand why we need stacks, queues, or linked lists when arrays seemed enough. But slowly, I realized how each data structure is built for a purpose and how important efficiency is in solving problems. Implementing them myself gave me clarity. It was not just about syntax but about thinking logically. I still see DSA as something that strengthens problem-solving skills and makes me more confident when approaching coding challenges.",

I was nervous at first because the time limit felt stressful, but working with a team on a real problem taught me things I could never learn from books. I learned to divide tasks, adjust when something didn’t work, and still present whatever we built. It gave me confidence to participate in more events. I realized that hackathons are not about winning but about learning how to think, communicate, and build under pressure.",

At first, JavaScript everywhere felt overwhelming, but it also felt powerful to handle both frontend and backend with one language. Building projects using React and Express made me understand how modern apps are structured. I also learned how important APIs are for connecting different parts of an application. MERN stack gave me the confidence that I can bring an idea to life end-to-end, not just design its frontend.",

//       "AI is everywhere in the news and discussions, but when I started exploring it, I realized it’s not magic—it’s data, logic, and models. Even a simple face recognition project taught me that AI depends on how we train it and the data we use. It made me think about both the opportunities and responsibilities. AI can solve real-world problems, but it also needs to be used carefully. For me, AI is not just a subject but a tool that can change how we live and work, and I want to keep exploring it step by step.",

//     "At first I only knew about websites as something we use daily. But it all started when I started watching youtube tutorials in my mom's phone when I was in 9th grade to see how we make those beautiful modern websites. But at that time I didn't had a laptop so I couldn't complete it. In my second year of college when I finally got a laptop, I started learning frontend development thinking it was all what was required for making a website. I bought a course which was all about creative development and spent 4 months learning the animations and transitions. When I realised that there was something like the backend as well, I felt that course was a complete waste of time. But after learning the backend, I realised that frontend development is not just about desiging an interface but also a way to deliver value of a brand and convey their message. Now I feel that the learning Creative Development was most enjoyable part of my learning journey and the course was worth it.",
